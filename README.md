# Home Assistant Power Station Interface

![ESP-FBot Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ylianst/ESP-FBot/refs/heads/main/docs/images/main.png)

This is a HomeAssistant, ESP-Home custom component for locally monitoring and controlling battery systems via Bluetooth. Should work with the following batteries:

 - [FOSSiBOT F3600 Pro](https://www.fossibot.com/products/fossibot-f3600-pro), [FOSSiBOT F2400](https://www.fossibot.com/products/fossibot-f2400)
 - [SYDPOWER N052](https://www.sydpower.com/product/n052?id=665461cb8b0da4a4e43e4609), [SYDPOWER N066](https://www.sydpower.com/product/detail?id=665462e4a7c432936b1b583d)
 - [AFERIY P210](https://www.aferiy.com/products/aferiy-p210-portable-power-station-2400w-2048wh), [AFERIY P310](https://www.aferiy.com/products/aferiy-p310-portable-power-station-3300w-3840wh)
 - [ABOK Power Ark3600](https://abokpower.com/all-products/portable-power-station-3600/) (Probalby works, but not tested)
 
Basically, any power station that works with the "BrightEMS" application. You normally manage these batteries thru a cloud service, which is not ideal in outage situations. Instead, you can get fast local management by loading this ESP-Home component on a small device near the battery. The device will communicate to the battery using Bluetooth and relay the data locally using WIFI to Home Assistant.

## Features

- **Battery Monitoring**: Real-time battery state of charge (%), remaining capacity (kWh), and time remaining
- **Power Monitoring**: Track input power, output power, system consumption, and total power flow
- **Output Control**: Switch USB ports, DC outputs, AC inverter, and light on/off
- **Home Assistant Integration**: All sensors and controls automatically discovered in Home Assistant
- **Auto-reconnect**: Handles BLE disconnections and automatically reconnects

## Requirements

- A compatible battery that makes use of the "BrightEMS" application. You do not need to pair the battery to WIFI.
- You need [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) installed with the [ESP-Home](https://esphome.io/) add-in.
- I suggest the [M5Stack ATOM Light](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/atom-lite-esp32-development-kit) device, but most ESP32 devices (ESP32-WROOM, ESP32-DevKit, etc.) will do.
- The ESP32 device will need to be within range of the battery (typically 10-30 feet)

## Getting the MAC address

You will need to get the Bluetooth LE MAC address of your battery. Search for a Bluetooth LE device that starts with the name "FOSSIBOT" or "POWER".

- On Windows, use [BluetoothLEView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/bluetooth_low_energy_scanner.html)

The MAC address will look like "A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6".

## Installation

Assuming you have Home Assistant and ESP-Home installed and know how to use it.

1. Use the example configuration below as a starting point.
2. Update WiFi credentials, API encryption key and Battery MAC address.
3. Flash to your ESP32 device.

## Configuration

Here is a ESP-Home configuration you can use. Make sure to put your own API and OTA keys and fill in the Bluetooth LE MAC address of your power station.

## Battery Factory Reset

If this integration works for you and want to remove your battery WIFI connection to the cloud, you can do a factory reset of the battery. Press and hold the `DC button`, `light button` and `USB button` simultaneously for about 5 seconds. You will hear a beep.
